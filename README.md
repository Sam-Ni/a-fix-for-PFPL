# A Fix for the Proof of Fixed Point Induction in PFPL

## Authors

Yicheng Ni and [Yuting Wang](https://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/~yutingwang/) from Shanghai Jiao Tong University

## Overview

When we are formalizing in Coq the theory about equational reasoning in Practical Foundations for
Programming Languages (PFPL), we find the proof of a theorem in the book problematic.
We fix the proof and formalize the theorems in PFPL in Coq.

### Notes for the fix

The notes for our fix for the proof of Fixed Point Induction in PFPL lies in
[notes](https://sam-ni.github.io/a-fix-for-the-proof-of-fixed-point-induction-in-PFPL/main.pdf).

### Formalization
